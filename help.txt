1. How to use:

- Click on the pencil image to see/edit the words list and their
  definitions as well. If you want to edit the lists, make sure to
  click the REFRESH button before you run the program.
- Choose how to show up the word (consequently, randomly)
- Choose how to repeat the unknown words (after a specific amount 
  of time or a specific number of words passed).

       "next" 3 time, the unknown word that you clicked "repeat" 
       before will show up.
